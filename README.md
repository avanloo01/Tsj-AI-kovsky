This repository contains the code I used to clean up my dataset for [lightweight GAN](https://github.com/lucidrains/lightweight-gan). In addition, I also used [SmartCropper](https://github.com/Chen-and-Sim/SmartCropper).

You can also find results in this repository.

I used [IMSLP](https://imslp.org) to create my dataset.
